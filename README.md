# jquery-project-rpg

Context: I wanted to do a front-end project with some forms and user input. 
Action: I created a role-playing-game program with JQuery.
Result: The program lets the user create a character and play a game of simulated attack rolls and defense rolls.
Reflection: I had a lot of fun with this project and will add onto it in the future. A backend first, most likely.
